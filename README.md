# Automatic Differentiation Using CUDA - 15618

## Jay Patel (japatel) and Tanvi Karandikar (tkarandi)

We are going to implement automatic differentiation on GPU (CUDA) and compare it with a CPU version and perform a detailed analysis of both systemsâ€™ performance characteristics. Automatic differentiation will be supported for first-order partial derivatives of functions that are commonly used in Deep Learning i.e addition, multiplication, transpose, power, matrix multiplication (a stretch goal is to also support 2D convolution).
